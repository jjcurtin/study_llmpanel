I eat a variety of whole foods, including fruits and vegetables, most days.

I floss my teeth most days.

I get at least 6 hours of sleep most evenings.

I rarely or never drink 4 or more alcoholic drinks on the same day.

I engage in some physical activity (e.g., walking, stretching, light exercise) most weeks.
