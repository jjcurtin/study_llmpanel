<!--*Legitimizing*

Lyn original description:
This communication approach focuses on validating the individual’s emotional experience by explicitly recognizing their feelings as normal and appropriate. Key elements include acknowledging feelings as reasonable responses to their situation, validating the genuine difficulty of their experience, and assuring them that expressing these struggles is acceptable and expected in the recovery process. This approach helps reduce shame, blame, and isolation by normalizing emotional responses to recovery challenges.

Lyn original prompt:
The message should use a “Legitimization of Distress” approach by emphasizing that experiencing challenges, doubts, and strong feelings during recovery is normal and acceptable. Focus on conveying that these experiences are valid and expected, while maintaining a supportive and validating tone that reduces shame and isolation. Avoid naming specific emotions like guilt or fear, and do not provide direct advice using words such as “should” or “must.” Keep the overall message affirming and empathetic.

Original message tone survey description:
This message tone helps people feel heard and understood by letting them know their feelings are normal. It means saying things like, “It makes sense to feel that way,” or “What you’re going through is really hard.” It also lets them know it’s okay to talk about their struggles. This kind of support can help people feel less ashamed, less alone, and more accepted as they work through tough times.

Notes:
"It's okay to talk about my struggles" dropped because felt like second issue/trying to avoid double barreled items-->

1. ...lets me know that my feelings are normal. I want to be reminded that it is okay to feel this way and to not have my feelings minimized or dismissed.

Next, we want to know what kinds of messages you like to receive from smartphone apps. Think about apps you have used that send you reminder messages (also called "push notifications"). We want to know *your* specific preferences about how those messages are written.

Do you prefer these types of reminder messages to be more **formal** (for example, professional or polite -- like how your doctor might speak to you) or **informal** (for example, casual or conversational -- like how your friend might message you)?
