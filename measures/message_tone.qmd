For the next series of questions, we will describe different tones and styles that the support messages can be written in.  We expect that people may differ in their preferred tones and styles for these messages and we want to know about your specific preferences.  It is fine to prefer one or many of the tones and styles.  Please rate each tone and style independently.

Remember to imagine that you are receiving these support messages in the context of an app designed to promote recovery from alcoholism.  For each support message tone or style, please read the description and then indicate how much you would like to receive a message in that particular tone or style.

1. Legitimizing tone

 - This message tone helps people feel heard and understood by letting them know their feelings are normal. It means saying things like, “It makes sense to feel that way,” or “What you’re going through is really hard.” It also lets them know it’s okay to talk about their struggles. This kind of support can help people feel less ashamed, less alone, and more accepted as they work through tough times.

2. Caring/Supportive tone

 - This message tone focuses on building trust and showing real care. It means accepting the person without judging them, showing care about what they’re going through, and letting them know that help is available. It also means being a supportive teammate in their recovery, without pretending to know exactly how they feel. This helps the person feel safe, accepted, and not alone.

3. Self-Efficacy tone

 - This message tone helps people feel confident using the app. It focuses on their strengths and reminds them that they have what it takes to keep going. It shows that recovery is something they can do and that using the app is a helpful, doable part of that. The goal is to make things feel possible, not overwhelming, and to let them know they have the ability to take steps forward.

4. Acknowledging tone

 - This message tone is about really listening and helping someone explore their feelings without telling them what to think. It means showing care about what they’re feeling, gently offering ideas about their emotions, and repeating back what they say in a clear and caring way. It also means asking questions that help them think more, without making them feel pressured. This helps the person understand their feelings better and feel supported while they figure things out.

5. Value Affirmation tone

 - This message tone helps people connect their recovery with what matters most to them. It doesn’t guess what their values are, but instead reminds them why they started this journey; like wanting to be there for family, do well at work, or feel healthier. It shows how using the app and working on recovery can help them reach those goals and stay true to what’s important in their life.

6. Norms tone

 - This message tone lets people know they’re not alone. It shows that others like them have used the app and found it helpful for things like handling cravings and managing stress. By sharing that people with similar struggles have seen good results, it helps build hope and a sense of connection. It reminds them that they’re part of a shared journey and that others have been successful too.

7. Formal style

 - This message style will use language in a formal and professional way, as if the message came from your doctor or nurse.

8. Informal style

 - This message style will use language in an informal way, as if the message came from a friend.
