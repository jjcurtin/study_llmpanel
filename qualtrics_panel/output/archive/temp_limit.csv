While your lapse risk is high and still increasing right now, facing hurdles and stronger thoughts isn’t unusual; it’s part of building resilience over time. This moment reflects the complexity of change, and it's okay to have challenging periods on a brave path like the one you're taking. You are persevering through something that matters deeply and means you’re being genuine about growth in your recovery."

Just because lapse risk is growing doesn’t mean your progress is any less real or less valuable. Strong feelings and doubts are part of this journey for most and genuinely deserve space and understanding. Press forward knowing these tougher moments don’t define you—they’re only one part of the healing process."
