Meeting with Colin

Decisions Made:
- Temperature will be set to 1.0 for message generation due to variability and the decision that 
  readability is not significantly and consistently impacted by temperature as much as by the prompt itself.
- Panel study will only use four user contexts but all other variables will be fully crossed to create 72 messages.

Colin TODO:
- Update system prompt and user prompts to remove redundant and/or unnecessary information (should/must etc.)   DONE
- Move information about prompts from script to text files (will eventually be conditional on info received)    DONE
- Update descriptions of each message category and add examples without user context
- Remove all em dashes from every source                                                                        DONE
- Update tone category to only have one Likert scale question (not the helpful one)                             DONE
- Add formality survey in addition to tone preference survey
- Look into Assistant mode for previous messages
- Look into max tokens
- Generate Qualtrics survey with sample 72 questions for John/Rachel's approval

Additional Questions:
- Which user contexts do we choose?

John TODO:
- Ask Susan about multiple surveys in Qualtrics
- Give Rachel Qualtrics survey generated by Colin (pending)

Meeting with Colin

Need to

- JJC to update analysis of writing metrics for tones and formality and temperature
- Review general system prompt and move toward finalizing
- Fine tune user prompts for each of the tones
- Consider user prompt for formality of tone                                            DONE
- Make decision on temperature
- Colin will update code to ignore context other than lapse prob/change                 DONE
- Colin will update code to add a file to describe use prompt info for formality        DONE
- Need decision on "just the facts" tone.  How will it work if there are no facts?
- Current system prompt no longer reports on output from model.  Are we OK with that?

Lab meeting

- Messages will be grouped by context (e.g., high and increasing lapse probability).   This will allow us to have a stem where we acknowledge the context and then ask participants to rate each message in that context.  "Imagine this is for a person who is… (high risk, increasing, etc).  Not yet sure how to handle important feature as part of context

- For each message, they will respond to two questions: I liked it, I find it helpful. These are from the message questionnaire for optimize. Response scale 7pt Likert; Agree strongly to Disagree Strongly.

- We want large pool of messages within each tone with participants getting different example messages.   May need to finesse this in Qualtrics

- Tone preference survey will include short description of each tone category and maybe a short example (without context info?)

Tones to be included (see doc from Lyn's notes in notes folder)
1.     Legitimization of Distress
2.     Caring / Supportive
3.     Self Efficacy
4.     Acknowledgement of Feelings
5.     Value Affirmation
6.     Norms
7.     We will consider a 7th tone category - "Just the facts"  for example some veterans do not want any excess wording for encouragement.  How to handle this category if the person in the optimize project isnt getting any feedback?

- Note that we decided to DROP the response efficacy tone category suggested by Lyn.

- We also considered several orthogonal manipulations that could be crossed with tone category

  - We are still considering formality of the tone (i.e., Peer vs. Authority) 

  - We will NOT manipulate autonomy but instead put some statements about this into the system prompt. We want to avoid “should” and “must” language and emphasize that they know themselves best and it is their decision and that they have option of how to use the app.   We felt that positive statements about autonomy (You know best. You are the final authority on what to do) might get repetitive if included in all messages in this condition.)

- We will NOT manipulate positive tone but instead work to have the system prompt use mild to moderate positive tone consistent with that increasing engagement.
 
- We will NOT manipulate temperature but instead pick one based on our EDA
