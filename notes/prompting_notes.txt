GPT does not listen if I ask it to not include the em dash.

By far the best method of reducing repetition across messages with identical contexts is including the previous message 
in the prompt. However, the second, third, etc. messages generated tend to be similar to one another as well.
Seems to be mostly deterministic if the temperature parameter is set to zero

Temperature is decent for increasing varation but does not always change the message on independent calls whereas
including the most recent prompt always does.
